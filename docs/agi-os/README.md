# AGI-OS Kernel Stack Documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive mapping of the cogpy GitHub organization repositories (~120 repos) and their roles in the AGI-OS initiative, which centers on the integration of the Operational Cognitive Core (OCC) with Echo.Kern.

## üìö Documentation Structure

- **[Core Kernel Repositories](./01-core-kernel-repos.md)** - Low-level kernel repositories forming the foundation
- **[Cognitive Framework Layer](./02-cognitive-framework-layer.md)** - OCC-equivalents and AGI runtime components
- **[Platform & Driver Repos](./03-platform-driver-repos.md)** - Extensions and HAL equivalents
- **[Userland & Application Layer](./04-userland-application-layer.md)** - Application ecosystems and services
- **[5-Repo Bridge Set](./05-bridge-set-integration.md)** - Critical integration paths for OCC ‚Üî Echo.Kern
- **[Visual Dependency Graph](./06-dependency-graph.md)** - Repository relationships and readiness levels

## üéØ AGI-OS Initiative Overview

The AGI-OS initiative aims to create a neuromorphic operating system that bridges traditional kernel architecture with cognitive/agentic frameworks. The core integration involves:

- **OCC (Operational Cognitive Core)**: The cognitive evaluation and orchestration layer
- **Echo.Kern**: DTESN (Dynamic Temporal Echo State Network) neuromorphic microkernel
- **Kernel Stack**: Supporting repositories providing boot, scheduling, memory, IPC, and I/O primitives

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Layers

The repository ecosystem is organized into four primary layers:

1. **Core/Low-Level Kernel** - Syscalls, memory management, scheduling, I/O primitives
2. **Cognitive/Agentic Framework** - Agent orchestration, evaluation, and runtime
3. **Platform & Driver Support** - Hardware abstraction, extensions, and specialized services
4. **Userland & Applications** - End-user services, tools, and SDKs

## üöÄ Getting Started

To understand the AGI-OS architecture, start with:
1. Read the [Core Kernel Repositories](./01-core-kernel-repos.md) to understand the foundation
2. Explore the [5-Repo Bridge Set](./05-bridge-set-integration.md) for integration patterns
3. Review the [Visual Dependency Graph](./06-dependency-graph.md) for the complete picture

## üìä Repository Statistics

- **Total Repositories**: ~120
- **Core Kernel Repos**: 14
- **Cognitive Framework Repos**: 15
- **Platform & Driver Repos**: 16
- **Userland/Application Repos**: 75+
